# Task
Predict the likelihood of a genome sequence undergoing mutation.

# Description
A mutation is a change in a small section of a genome's nucleotide sequence. Many mutations are point mutations, in which one nucleotide is replaced by another, while others involve the insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides. Mutations are caused by errors in DNA replication or the adverse impacts of mutagens, such as chemicals and radiation, which react with DNA and alter the structures of individual nucleotides.
Your task is to predict the probability of a genome sequence undergoing mutation, given certain environmental conditions, and a genome sequence divided into 9 sub-sequences.
